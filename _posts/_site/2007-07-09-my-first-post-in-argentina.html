When I was in Spain, where I spent five years of my life, one of those opportunities that only happen to you a few times in life, appeared on my way.

So I took the chance of going back to my beloved country to take advantage of it.
<h3>HERE IS A BRIEF STORY ABOUT ME</h3>
<a href="http://yauykg.blu.livefilestore.com/y1pe7Q3tmlVXP5ZBXDSeoTuYTjfcl-Iit8_13pWu3KLVUk6MXcfHeqDuVXeISJiifRYI1wTNPIXCEY36jdqym6p_w/argentina_flag.JPG"><img src="http://yauykg.blu.livefilestore.com/y1pe7Q3tmlVXP5ZBXDSeoTuYTjfcl-Iit8_13pWu3KLVUk6MXcfHeqDuVXeISJiifRYI1wTNPIXCEY36jdqym6p_w/argentina_flag.JPG" border="0" alt="argentina_flag" width="145" height="95" align="right" /></a> Two years ago, when I was still living in Spain, I went on vacation to Argentina. There I had an Interview with <a href="http://staff.southworks.net/blogs/alejack/default.aspx" target="_blank">Alejandro Jack</a> who I had met before when I was working in my last job in Argentina.

We talked about many things by that time, but the development of the company was, in fact, the most interesting topic.

By that time, I had a Computer company in Seville, so I had to find the best way possible to have all set up for my return. It was not easy to close down my business, because it is not something that can be done in a couple of days. That is why I decided to stay there for a while to do everything the right way.

Alex had added me to a Southworks developers distribution list. So I started to receive e-mails detailing the company's progress and the experience of new Southies who would join it.

Alex and the Southies became idols for me. Being able to see how they had been growing as a company, and acquiring the position Southworks has nowadays at a world-wide level in only a couple of years, was great.

I also started to know about the people who were part of the company. Good examples are <a href="http://staff.southworks.net/blogs/ariel/default.aspx" target="_blank">Ariel Schapiro</a>, <a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/blogs/matiaswoloski/default.aspx" target="_blank">Matías Woloski</a>, <a href="http://staff.southworks.net/blogs/johnny/default.aspx" target="_blank">Johnny Halife</a>, <a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/blogs/lito/default.aspx" target="_blank">Lito Damiani</a>, <a href="http://staff.southworks.net/blogs/beto/default.aspx" target="_blank">Alberto Ortega</a>, etc.

So, once my business in Spain was closed down, and after I had analyzed the pros and cons of going back to Argentina, on January 10th 2007 I contacted Alex to have a formal talk about my incorporation to Southworks.

Now I'm here, posting this, surrounded by the ones I admire :)
