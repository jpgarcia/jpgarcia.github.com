On December 11, 2008 we gave a Webcast for Latin American Community with my friend and mentor <a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/jhalife/">Johnny Halife</a> about how to develop distributed applications by using <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hpc/en/us/default.aspx">Windows HPC Server 2008</a>.

The objective of the talk was about to explain the platform that <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hpc/en/us/default.aspx">Windows HPC Server 200</a>8 provide us to build distributed applications with a SOA architecture by using Windows Communication Foundation (WCF).

In addition we had the opportunity to make a small demo creating a simple application on our lab deployed at <a href="http://www.southworks.net">Southworks</a>.
