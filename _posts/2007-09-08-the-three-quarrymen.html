<p>I would like to share with you a story that I've read in a Spanish book called <em>&#8220;Companies' Failure's causes&#8221; (how to learn from other people's experience)</em> by Enrique Zamorano. So, this extract says&#8230; </p>  

<p><em>There are three quarrymen at the foot of a cathedral doing the same job: sculpting stones.</em></p>  

<p><em>A stranger gets closer to one of them and asks: &#8220;<strong>What are you doing?</strong>&#8221;</em></p>  

<p><em>The quarryman answers: &#8220;<strong>I&#8217;m sculpting stones</strong>&#8221; and, with his bad-tempered look, he adds: &#8220;<strong>Can&#8217;t you see it?</strong>&#8221;</em></p>  

<p><em>The second one replies saying: &#8220;<strong>I&#8217;m earning my living</strong>&#8221; and his gesture seems to say: &#8220;<strong>It&#8217;s too hard, you know?</strong>&#8221;</em></p>  

<p><em>When the third man hears the question, he brings up his head, glances up, and with his eyes shining, he says: &#8220;<strong>I&#8217;m building a cathedral</strong>&#8221;</em></p>  <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>  

<p>The same action could have different meanings. The third quarryman is, indeed, who does his job with excellence: he takes his work as a challenge and does it with passion.</p>
